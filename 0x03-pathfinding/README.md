## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What is pathfinding
* What are the most common applications of pathfinding
* What is backtracking, and why you should never use it
* What is Dijkstra’s algorithm, and what is its main weakness
* What is A star algorithm, and how it is better than Dijkstra’s

---

### [0. Backtracking - Array](./0-backtracking_array.c)
* Write a function that searches for the first path from a starting point to a target point within a two-dimensional array.


### [1. Backtracking - Graph](./1-backtracking_graph.c)
* Write a function that searches for the first path from a starting point to a target point in a graph.


### [2. Dijkstra's - Graph](./2-dijkstra_graph.c)
* Write a function that searches for the shortest path from a starting point to a target point in a graph.
