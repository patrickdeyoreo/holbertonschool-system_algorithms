## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What is a graph
* What are vertices and edges
* What are the different types of graphs (directed, weighted, â€¦)
* What are the most common ways used to represent graphs in C
* How to traverse a graph using DFS and BFS

---

### [0. Create graph](./0-graph_create.c)
* Write a function that allocates memory to store a graph_t structure, and initializes its content.


### [1. Add a vertex](./1-graph_add_vertex.c)
* Write a function that adds a vertex to an existing graph


### [2. Add an edge](./2-graph_add_edge.c)
* Write a function that adds an edge between two vertices to an existing graph


### [3. Delete graph](./3-graph_delete.c)
* Write a function that completely deletes a graph


### [4. Depth-first traversal](./4-depth_first_traverse.c)
* Write a function that goes through a graph using the depth-first algorithm.


### [5. Breadth-first traversal](./5-breadth_first_traverse.c)
* Write a function that goes through a graph using the breadth-first algorithm.
